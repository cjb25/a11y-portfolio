          <h2>What is A11y?</h2>
          <p>
            "A11y" is short for "accessibility." There are 11 letters between
            the "A" and the "Y", and developers use it as shorthand. Accessibile
            means websites can be used by everyone, including people who are
            blind, visually impaired, use screen readers, or have other access
            needs.

        <!--why accessibility matters to me-->

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a legally blind developer-in-training, so this isn't just
            something I'm passionate about, it's my way of life. This portfolio
            is a living demonstration for my peers, instructors, and future
            collaborators and employers. I am transparent with my lived
            experience, hoping to increase awareness and show how accessibility
            can be meaningful, practical, and creative.

          <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            As you explore my site, you'll learn several ways to test
            accessibility using the tools I am most familiar with - JAWS, NVDA,
            VoiceOver, as well as keyboard navigation. You'll have the
            opportunity to experience firsthand the importance of building more
            inclusive designs from the start.
