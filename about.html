  <h2>Why I'm here</h2>
  <p>I love solving problems. I'm learning to break down barriers and eliminate vulnerabilities in my own life, and I want to use the knowledge I gain to build solutions that improve the quality of life for everyone. This is the opportunity of my lifetime - one where I can use my unique perspective and skills to become the creator of my circumstances, not just a survivor of them. </p>

    <h2>Gaining Vision</h2>
    <p>In 2020, I lost my physical sight suddenly. It changed everything about how I experience the world and how I connected to it. Adapting hasn't been easy, but it's been powerful. I've had to reorient not only to my daily life, but my entire way of thinking and learning.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Before that, I had a career I cared about deeply. Letting go of my job in order to learn how to navigate the world again was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. But that choice made room for something new: a chance to build my life centered around impact, purpose, and inclusion.</p>
<br>
<p>My path is forged by personal experiences as a survivor and advocate. I now use my insights to help others feel seen, included, and empowered through technology.</p>
